# R permission issue
It was a permission issue for me. First, I identified where the packages were installed using 
installed.packages()[, c("Package", "LibPath")]. This outputs a long 2 column matrix with the
names and locations of the packages. Then you will see where the offending packages are. 
In my case, they were at /usr/lib/R/site-library and /usr/lib/R/library. 
Then I changed the permission of these folders by chmod 
(I used chmod -R 777 on the main R folder, 
this is my personal computer, so security is not a big concern here I think)

# Set path for software
# set PATH for anaconda
export PATH="/home/mwen/anaconda3/bin:$PATH"

# make a shortcut for remote server account directory
sftp://mwen@genologin.toulouse.inra.fr/work/mwen/

# connect virtual system to computer folder
1. goto control/settings/share folder to set a host_share folder
2. sudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-additions-iso2. 
2. sudo groupadd vboxsf
3. sudo usermod -aG vboxsf mwen
2. sudo mount -t vboxsf host_share guest_share
