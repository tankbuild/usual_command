1. Use expression with a variable r

assay <- "Some Assay"
xlab <- bquote(.(assay) ~ AC50 ~ (mu*M))
plot(0, xlab = xlab)

Note: The ~ is a spacing operator and * means juxtapose the contents to the left and right of the operator.
In bquote(), anything wrapped in .( ) will be looked up and replaced with the value of the named object; 
so .(assay) will be replaced in the expression with Some Assay.

* Try to set xlab to expression(bold(atop("Ameiurus", "melas")))
